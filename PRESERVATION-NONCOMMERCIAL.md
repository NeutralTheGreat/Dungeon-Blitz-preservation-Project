## Preservation & Non-Commercial Use Declaration

### 1. Purpose of This Project
This project exists solely to **preserve**, **study**, and **document** the original Dungeon Blitz game after its shutdown.  


This repository provides:
- Research documentation  
- Reverse-engineered server behavior  
- Reconstruction of client/server logic  
- Educational materials for archival and preservation  

### 2. Non-Commercial Requirement
All content in this repository — including code, files, documentation, and research — is provided **strictly for non-commercial use**.

You may **not**, under any circumstances:
- Sell access to the game or server  
- Use the codebase in any paid service  
- Attach advertisements, microtransactions, donations, or monetized systems  
- Host paid private servers  
- Create NFTs or commercial derivatives  
- Claim affiliation with the original developers  

Any attempt to commercialize the project is strictly forbidden and violates the intent of this preservation effort.

### 3. Use of Game Assets
All original Dungeon Blitz game assets remain the property of their respective rights holders.  
This project does **not** grant rights to:
- Redistribute assets commercially  
- Use assets outside preservation and academic research  
- Claim ownership of Dungeon Blitz intellectual property  

### 4. Forks and Derivative Projects
Forks are allowed under GPL-3, but **they must also remain strictly non-commercial**.

Forks that:
- Monetize the project  
- Misrepresent affiliation  
- Enable scams  
- Distribute assets irresponsibly  
may be subject to takedown action.

### 5. Takedown & Abuse Policy
If this project (or its forks) is used for:
- Commercial exploitation  
- Scams or impersonation  
- Unauthorized paid hosting  
- Misleading branding  
- Distribution harmful to the preservation community  

The project maintainers reserve the right to:
